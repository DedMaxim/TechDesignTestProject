# TechDesignTestProject_Maxim_Bondarenko
Test task for Elephant Games


This task is completed in one Sunday and a portion of Monday evening.

Unity version used 2021.3.32f. "Why? The task clearly says that version 2021.3.15f must be used!".
I was not able to boot this version on my machine.
I belevie it is an issue with a licence because if I delete .ulf file in Program data Unity boots up and asks to activate a licence.
With active licence, not even a splash sceen shows up. Maybe the licence has changed since that version of Unity?
I decided to not waste any more time and just use a closest version I'm able to boot with my current licence.
This version turned out to be 2021.3.32f, which is also a LTS version so it could be the reason it works.

As Git application, GitHub Desktop is used.

Spine Runtime is version 3.8, since it is the version I found an animation for.
